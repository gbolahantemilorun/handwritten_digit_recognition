Convolution Neural Network Model for Handwritten Digit Recognition
The study of handwritten digits character recognition, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), is important for several reasons including document digitization, form processing, banking and finance, handwritten-based user authentication and so on. The task here is to correctly classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset can be found at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Based on this task, the following objectives will be addressed: a) How the use of different regularisation methods affect the performance of your CNN model; b) How changes to the number of convolution blocks affect the performance of your model quantitatively; c) The effect of varying learning rates on the performance of the CNN algorithm; d) Checking if there is a case of overfitting observed in the model at any point.
